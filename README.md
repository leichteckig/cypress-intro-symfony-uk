# cypress-intro-symfony-uk

Here you can find the test examples of my session at Symfony UK meetup, from 28.10.2020.

## Talk abstract

When it comes to UI testing, some developers tend to be reluctant a lot. Are those tests slow, flaky, hard to write and maintain?

Cypress.io (or Cypress for short) is currently getting a lot of attention when it comes to end-to-end testing. Especially in JavaScript environments Cypress.io seems to be slowly gaining acceptance. It does a lot of things right and is preferable to selenium-based approaches in my opinion.

In my session, I want to introduce Cypress to you and explore its possibilities by writing first tests for the https://symfony.com/ website (or any other if I need more test cases) - so that we can overcome those concerns together.
